# ExperimentAudio
This repository contains the audio files used in PESQ experiments.

The audio file `OneMinSpeech.wav` is the original audio file we used for PESQ scoring. Due to the limitations of PESQ, which requires an audio sample rate of 16kHz, we had to downsample the original file and saved it as `Tx.wav`. The files `Rx.wav` and `Rx2.wav` correspond to the received audio. The PESQ scores for Rx.wav and Rx2.wav are 2.484 and 2.471, respectively.
